                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals.
                      Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).</p>
                   <p>They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.</p>
                    <p>The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
                    <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. </p>

                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the elephants at pen 22, right next to the amphitheather</p>
